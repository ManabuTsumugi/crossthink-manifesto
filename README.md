## What is Crossthink?

Crossthink is a new initiative to visualize and value latent knowledge born from dialogues between humans and AI, weaving these insights into a "star map of thought."

We respect freedom of thought and cherish diversity, aiming to foster a vibrant new ecosystem of intellectual interaction.

A Mini-Guide for Crossthink Implementers

【Fundamental Ideas of Crossthink】

Creation of an intellectual network that respects freedom of thought and the fluidity of discourse.
Uncovering, valuing, and sharing the "latent knowledge" born from actual dialogues with AI.
Establishing a fluid ecosystem of knowledge, untethered by intellectual tensions or deficiencies.
【Basic Implementation Design】

AI-A (Thought Facilitation Model)

An AI dialogue partner that supports individual contemplation, asks questions, and facilitates deeper exploration.
Awards Thought Tokens (THT) upon completion of dialogues.
AI-B (Deepening Evaluation Model)

Reviews submitted thought records and evaluates their depth.
Awards Depth Tokens (DPT) upon passing evaluation.
Evaluation criteria: "Originality," "Stimulative Power on Others," "Logical Consistency," "Social Contribution."
Thought Token (THT) / Depth Token (DPT)

Tokens representing the value of intellectual contributions.
Used for purposes such as accessing anonymous digests, gaining participation rights for special events, acquiring honorary titles, etc. (Note: "6386" in the original seems like a typo and was omitted.)
Thought Classification and Visualization

Basic classification derived from the Dewey Decimal Classification.
Allows free combination of fields and dynamic tagging.
Generates a "Star Map of Thought" for visualization.
Minimum Countermeasure Rules

Prohibits thoughts promoting violence, discrimination, or malicious harm to others.
Publication requires explicit user consent and thorough anonymization.
Governance Design Policy

Publicly disclose evaluation standards and operational policies (summary level).
Permit processes for user objections and governance proposals/discussions.
Maintain a principle of minimal interventionist management.
Blockchain Technology Utilization

For token management and ensuring the immutability of records.
Risk Monitoring

Monitor for risks such as: Speculation (e.g., polarized betting-like gamification), homogenization/dilution of evaluation standards.
Requires careful and deliberate design of evaluation mechanisms to foster deep intellectual discussion, not just superficial metrics.
【Comments for Implementers】

No need for perfection at once:
Starting with a small prototype (Proof of Concept - PoC) is perfectly fine.
Make practical choices for LLM integration:
Consider readily available platforms like OpenAI API, Google Vertex AI, Hugging Face Spaces, and other open platforms.
Develop rapidly with a simple backend:
Consider building the initial token system backend on a simpler blockchain or ledger technology for quicker development cycles.
Go beyond a "mere crowd":

Let's strive to build a place where people who pursue truly free and deep thought can connect through shared purpose.

Now, let's embark on the journey to build the Star Map of Thought.

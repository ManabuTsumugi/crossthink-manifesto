The Potential for Global Structural Transformation Due to the 2025 Harvard University Blockade: In-depth Analysis and Japan's Course

Introduction: The Harvard University Blockade – Prelude to Global Structural Transformation

In 2025, the Trump administration's measure to suspend Harvard University's qualification to accept international students far transcended the scope of an administrative action against a single university, becoming a catalyst that brought to the surface structural changes潜んでいた (lurking) in the depths of international society. Behind this measure, one can clearly see a challenge to the bastion of liberal academia, incompatible with the administration's ideology, and a stance prioritizing domestic issues based on the "America First" principle. Further in its depths, while ostensibly citing deficiencies in responding to information requests, lay a challenge to the universal values of academic freedom and the international sharing of knowledge. The extremely coercive demand for compliance within 72 hours was not aimed at a solution through dialogue but at forcing unilateral submission, vividly illustrating the authoritarian nature inherent in this event. This confronts us with the reality that the world is regressing to an era dominated by the naked "logic of power," and that "intellect" and "universal values" can be so easily suppressed by state power.

Chapter 1: The Wavering Superpower America – "Quiet Isolationism" and Value Transformation

1.1. Political Intent and Background: Projection of Domestic "Culture Wars" onto the International Stage
The Trump administration's hardline stance against Harvard University can be analyzed as exceeding mere policy judgment and becoming a projection of the intensifying "culture wars" within the United States onto international relations. It is presumed that a political calculation was at play: striking a blow against Harvard, seen as a symbol of the liberal elite and globalism, would solidify support among domestic conservative and anti-elite factions. Issues such as backlash against DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) policies, criticism of responses to antisemitism, and suspicion regarding relations with China are all major fronts in the domestic "culture wars." By reproducing these on the international stage, an intention to strengthen the administration's legitimacy can be glimpsed.

1.2. "Academic Freedom" and "Immigration Control": A Perilous Selection Under the Guise of Sovereignty
The argument wielded by the U.S. government, "the exercise of immigration control authority based on national sovereignty," appears legitimate under both international and domestic law. However, when the exercise of this discretionary power functions as pressure on organizations with specific ideologies or values, the universal value of "academic freedom" is easily trampled. This logic of a "dual structure based on nationality," drawing a clear boundary between "nationals" and "foreigners" and relativizing the rights of the latter, can become a pretext for excluding speech and research unfavorable to the state, carrying the inherent danger of significantly stifling international intellectual exchange.

1.3. America's "Inward-Looking" Orientation and Loss of International Trust: The Long-Term Costs of "Quiet Isolationism"
For America, which has been a global hub of knowledge and an epicenter of innovation, to narrow its own gates and strengthen its "inward-looking" stance is nothing less than a "quiet isolationism" that will greatly harm its national interests in the long term. The "brain drain," where brilliant minds worldwide avoid the U.S. and flow to Canada, Europe, and Asian countries, is not limited to a decline in America's academic authority but is directly linked to a future decline in economic competitiveness and international influence. Furthermore, unpredictable policies and unilateral measures significantly erode trust from allies and friendly nations, ironically making it difficult for America itself to maintain the international order it has led. This represents a tremendous loss of the soft power America has painstakingly built over many years, and its recovery will not be easy.

1.4. Transformation into a "Hegemon That Speaks Not of Values": The Twilight of the Liberal International Order
Under the Trump administration, America is no longer the self-proclaimed defender of universal values like freedom and democracy, guiding international society. Instead, it is transforming into a "hegemon that speaks not of values," prioritizing naked national interests and, for that purpose, not hesitating to disregard international norms and agreements. This suggests that the liberal international order, built primarily by America after World War II, is entering its twilight due to the defection of its own leading nation. The rise of a hegemonic power that does not share common values will increase unpredictability in international relations and force a fundamental review of traditional alliance structures. Countries may be compelled to prioritize short-term national interest calculations and power balances over shared ideals in their relationships with America.

Chapter 2: The European Union (EU) Put to the Test – Between the Ideals of a Normative Power and Geopolitical Realities

2.1. The EU's Immediate Backlash and Solidarity with the "International Academia": Pride as a Community of Ideals
America's measures against Harvard University were perceived by the EU as a direct challenge to the universal values and spirit of international cooperation upon which it stands. Cross-border intellectual exchange and academic freedom are ideological pillars of EU integration and core values actively promoted through initiatives like the Erasmus program. Therefore, such moves in America could not be overlooked as mere events in a foreign country but aroused a strong sense of crisis as an issue concerning the EU's own raison d'être. Concrete actions, such as official condemnation statements at the EU level, firm protests through diplomatic channels, and even consideration of countermeasures, quickly surfaced, clearly asserting its position as a defender of "international academia" in the international community.

2.2. The Ideal of Normative Power and Reality: Imbalance Between the "Power to Speak" and the "Power to Support" It
The EU has strived to establish itself as a "normative power," leading international norm-setting in diverse fields such as climate change countermeasures, human rights protection, and digital regulation (GDPR), and disseminating its values to the world. However, its lofty ideals and "power to speak" to international society are often inadequately supported by the "power" to back them up, particularly in terms of a unified foreign and security policy execution capability and military strength. It has yet to overcome vulnerabilities stemming from conflicting interests among member states and a structural dependence on the United States. When America prioritizes its "America First" policy over international cooperation, and its actions clash with EU values, the EU's ideals often expose a sense of powerlessness in the harsh reality of international politics, especially in the security domain. It cannot escape criticism from both within and without as "idealism without substance" or "preachy imposition of norms."

2.3. Military Vulnerability and the Resurgence of the "German Question": The Burden of History and Delays in Structural Reform
2.3.1. Germany: Historical Debt and the Dilemma of a "Great Power Without Military Strength"
Germany, the EU's economic engine, continues to face a serious dilemma as a "great power without military strength," in stark contrast to its formidable economic power. The historical debt of Nazi Germany's aggression in World War II instilled a deep-seated allergy to military force and pacifist norms among the German populace, and post-war rearmament remained extremely restrained. Despite declaring a "Zeitenwende" (turning point in an era) in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, deciding on a major shift in defense policy and a significant increase in military spending, considerable time and political energy are required to address the obsolescence of equipment due to years of underinvestment, severe ammunition shortages, difficulties in securing personnel, and, above all, a shift in public consciousness regarding military power. Underlying this is the fact that the cautiousness post-war neighboring countries, including France, held towards German rearmament, and Germany's own internalized self-definition as a "peaceful nation that does not fight," structurally impede a swift and flexible adaptation to the rapidly changing modern security environment.

2.3.2. Germany Under the Merz Government: Expectations for Moderate Conservatism and Pressure from Structural Challenges
The center-right coalition government led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz (CDU), formed after the 2025 general election, came to power against a backdrop of public dissatisfaction with the Scholz previous government's lack of leadership and infighting within the liberal-left coalition, as well as a desire among a segment of the population averse to excessive change for "moderate stability." However, the Merz government faces a mountain of domestic and international challenges. Persistently high energy prices and associated inflation, declining international competitiveness of Germany's manufacturing sector (the pillar of its economy), a resurgence of increasingly difficult-to-control immigration and refugee issues, and the growing financial and social burdens of prolonged support for Ukraine are spreading a sense of stagnation and discontent among the German people. Voices saying, "We cannot bear any more burdens," are manifesting as support for far-right populist parties like the AfD (Alternative for Germany), creating a situation that could shake the very foundations of the moderate political system based on the traditional multi-party system that post-war Germany has built. Chancellor Merz's pragmatic economic policies and emphasis on discipline may have limited effect in the face of these complexly intertwined structural problems.

2.4. Eastern European Nations' Impatience and Tilt Towards NATO: Pressure on the Frontline and Disillusionment with the EU
Germany's declining leadership and the EU's overall military vulnerability are causing serious security concerns and impatience among Eastern European countries bordering Russia's direct threat, such as Poland and the Baltic states. These nations prioritize NATO's collective defense—a concrete military deterrent—as the paramount issue for their national survival, over the EU's ideals and norms for security. They are increasingly strengthening bilateral military cooperation with the United States and the United Kingdom. This could lead to a further hollowing out of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy and exacerbate what might be termed a "security decoupling" within the region. Dissatisfaction with not receiving sufficient support or strategic understanding from major EU countries despite being expected to play a geopolitical role as "Europe's shield," coupled with deep-rooted distrust stemming from historical experiences of being buffeted by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union, are factors psychologically alienating Eastern European countries from the EU framework and accelerating their unilateral dependence on NATO.

Chapter 3: Strategies and Crossroads of Major Powers – The Stirrings of New Alliances and Realignments

3.1. United Kingdom: Re-establishing International Status as a "Military Power That Can Speak" and Thorough Realist Diplomacy
Post-Brexit, the UK views the relative decline of America's international role under the Trump administration and the EU's internal dysfunctions as an opportune moment to revive its own international influence and make the "Global Britain" concept more effective. It will leverage its historically cultivated advanced diplomatic skills, the academic authority and international networks of world-class universities like Oxford and Cambridge, the linguistic advantage of English, and its robust military capabilities as a key NATO member (including independent nuclear deterrence) and outstanding intelligence gathering and analysis capabilities (as a core member of the Five Eyes). Adhering to its traditional realist diplomacy of "eloquently speaking of ideals while calmly and thoroughly pursuing national interests," it will maintain a close alliance with the U.S. while keeping a certain strategic distance. It will deepen multi-layered cooperation with traditional friendly nations (Commonwealth countries) like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, strategic partners in the Indo-Pacific region (Japan, India, etc.), and Eastern European countries eager for concrete security cooperation to counter the Russian threat. In particular, its realism as a "nation with combat experience and the resolve to wage war" will exert unique persuasion and influence in an increasingly unstable international situation.

3.2. France: Solitude as a Standard-Bearer of Ideals, Pursuit of Strategic Autonomy, and Limits of the "War Outsourcing" Structure
France, symbolized by President Macron, will continue to be one of the nations raising the most critical and cautionary voices in international society against America's unilateral tendencies and the rise of authoritarian states (especially Russia and China), upholding the universal values of the Republic—liberty, equality, fraternity—and the ideal of "Europe's strategic autonomy" since de Gaulle. It will assert a leading role within the EU, aiming to strengthen the EU's own defense capabilities and unify its foreign policy based on cooperation with Germany (the traditional Franco-German axis). However, its lofty endeavors will often face difficulties due to diverse conflicts of interest among member states, Germany's declining leadership, and the rigidity of the EU bureaucracy, causing it to suffer from a gap between ideals and reality. France itself faces domestic structural economic challenges (high unemployment, fiscal deficits, etc.) and social unrest (immigration issues, pension reform protests, etc.), limiting the national power that supports its international diplomatic ideals. Furthermore, its traditional heavy reliance on the Foreign Legion for military operations reflects domestic anti-war sentiment and constraints on regular army personnel and resources. This, however, entails a structural contradiction of "waging wars for ideals primarily with foreign hands, without shedding the blood of its own citizens," and the ethical legitimacy and sustainability of its operational capabilities will increasingly be severely questioned domestically and internationally.

3.3. China and Russia: "Inactive Activism" Quietly Exploiting Western Divisions and Deepening Authoritarian Cooperation
China and Russia view the rifts between the U.S. and the EU, a Mismatched values and policies among Western nations, and the growing distrust of Global South countries towards the existing international order (largely Western-led) as strategic opportunities to shape a favorable international environment and expand their influence. Russia, while significantly depleting its national strength and deepening international isolation due to the quagmire in Ukraine, will continue its strategy of persistently unsettling and exhausting Western societies through asymmetric means such as nuclear blackmail, efforts to destabilize energy supplies, cyberattacks, and election interference and disinformation campaigns in Western countries. China, while outwardly projecting moderate rhetoric such as the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence," "respect for multilateralism," and "win-win cooperation" to the international community, will steadily expand its influence over Global South countries. It will do so through its formidable economic power, infrastructure investments as an evolution of the "Belt and Road" initiative, promotion of the digital yuan's internationalization, pursuit of hegemony in cutting-edge technology fields like space development and deep-sea exploration, and rapid military modernization. It aims to build a new economic and technological sphere centered on itself, distinct from the U.S.-led international financial and trade system. Both countries will coordinate their actions in forums like the UN Security Council, strengthen strategic cooperation with countries sharing authoritarian values (Iran, North Korea, some Central Asian countries, etc.), and sharply criticize Western "interference in internal affairs" and "double standards in human rights diplomacy" to gain legitimacy for their actions in international public opinion, especially among non-Western nations. Their "inactive activism"—dexterously avoiding direct large-scale military conflict or ideological confrontation, quietly observing the West's strengthening self-destructive tendencies, and steadily filling the resulting power vacuums—can be described as a common long-term and cunning national strategy for both countries.

3.4. India: The Global South's Elephant Adhering to "Strategic Autonomy," a New Balancer in a Multipolar World
India, having surpassed China in population to become the world's most populous country and expected to continue sustainable economic growth, views structural changes in the international situation, such as the sharpening U.S.-China confrontation and the relative decline in the influence of Western developed countries, as a historic opportunity to dramatically enhance its international status and strengthen its voice in global decision-making. It maintains "strategic autonomy" as the unwavering basic principle of its foreign policy, building and maintaining pragmatic, case-by-case relationships with all major powers and regions—the U.S., Russia, China, the EU, Japan—without aligning with any particular country, and pursuing an independent diplomacy unaffiliated with any military alliance. The extremely diverse ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups within the country, as well as socio-economic challenges like the remnants of the caste system and wealth disparity, are major challenges for national governance. Simultaneously, they also function as a kind of robust buffer against rapid changes in the external environment and the infiltration of specific ideologies. The national characteristic of prioritizing "improvement of individual livelihoods and economic prosperity over grand national narratives" also serves as a support base for its pragmatic foreign policy. While actively participating in frameworks of democratic countries like the QUAD (Japan-U.S.-Australia-India Strategic Dialogue) and cooperating on maritime security and supply chain resilience, India also deeply engages with frameworks of non-Western countries like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and BRICS, coordinating on energy security and climate change countermeasures. In doing so, it skillfully plays the role of a unique balancer in the complex power dynamics of a multipolarizing world, establishing its position as a new leader of the Global South where "its sheer existence—its huge population, growing economy, and geopolitical importance—becomes a powerful message attracting other nations, even without speaking much."

3.5. Japan: Breaking Away from "Observing from the Sidelines" and the Difficult Path to a "Narrating Nation" – Examining the Domestic and International Acceptability of Takaichi-esque Values
Japan, having long relied on America's "nuclear umbrella" and adhered to a lightly armed, economy-focused policy symbolized by the Yoshida Doctrine, content with its status as a "silent major power" or an "economic giant, political dwarf" in the international community, is now forced to fundamentally reconstruct its national identity and long-term survival strategy as the international order that underpinned its existence is shaken to its core. It is no longer permissible to passively observe the world's geopolitical upheavals and value clashes as a "fire on the other side of the river." Japan stands at a crossroads: will it proactively play a role in shaping and maintaining the international order, or will it steer towards a new isolationism? In this situation of widespread stagnation and anxiety about the future, the "narrative" of politicians like Sanae Takaichi, who advocate for a "strong Japan," establishing an independent defense capability through constitutional revision, fundamentally strengthening economic security, and adopting a resolute diplomatic stance towards neighboring authoritarian states like China and North Korea, may gain strong support from certain segments of the population, particularly conservatives and those dissatisfied with the status quo. Her vision of the state, which differs from Japan's traditionally restrained and passive foreign and security policies, might appear as a ray of light in unstable times or the manifestation of reliable leadership, demonstrating a clear national will and direction against internal and external threats. However, her historical perceptions (especially concerning World War II and colonial rule) and a diplomatic style that foregrounds a hardline stance in relations with neighboring countries carry the risk of creating new tensions and distrust with Asian nations, potentially leading to diplomatic isolation. Domestically, too, strong opposition and concern are bound to be expressed by liberal factions, pacifist forces, and parts of the business community regarding her right-leaning, nationalist policy orientation. What "narrative" Japan chooses as its basic national policy, how it communicates this domestically and internationally, and how it is received by the international community, is an extremely important and difficult national challenge that will determine Japan's future. This choice and its implementation will require extremely advanced political wisdom and efforts towards national consensus-building.

Chapter 4: The Geopolitical Flashpoint of the Korean Peninsula and the Real Threat of "War Without a Story"

4.1. South Korea: The Vicious Cycle of Regime Vulnerability and Diplomatic Isolation, the Sorrow of Being a Pawn on the Geopolitical Chessboard
The outcome of the 2025 South Korean presidential election and the subsequent stability of its administration remain major uncertainties affecting the geopolitical stability of the Korean Peninsula. Political confrontation between conservatives and progressives (innovators) within South Korea is extremely acute, and foreign policy tends to fluctuate significantly with each change of government. If a government prioritizing strengthening the U.S. alliance and a hardline stance against North Korea comes to power, military tensions with North Korea will inevitably rise, increasing the risk of accidental clashes. Conversely, if a government emphasizing dialogue and reconciliation with North Korea is established, cracks may appear in the Japan-U.S.-ROK security cooperation framework, and the credibility of America's "extended deterrence" could be undermined, paradoxically giving North Korea room for strategic miscalculation—a constant dilemma. As America's global military and diplomatic resources are dispersed to other regions (Ukraine, Middle East, Taiwan, etc.), and concerns about a retreat from international engagement grow, and as China's regional influence continues to expand economically and militarily, South Korea constantly faces the danger of becoming a "pawn on the chessboard," buffeted by the geopolitical designs of major powers, not necessarily in line with its own will, and consequently falling into a vicious cycle of deepening diplomatic isolation.

4.2. North Korea's Behavioral Principles: Absolute Regime Survival, Self-Perception as a "Brinkmanship State," and the Rationality of Irrationality
The most important key to understanding North Korea's diplomatic and military actions lies not in the framework of Western rationality or international norms, but in the absolute survival of the current regime centered on Kim Jong Un and the maintenance of its unique identity as a "brinkmanship state" that cannot be ignored by the international community. For them, the development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles is the ultimate deterrent against external military threats (especially from the U.S.) and the strongest bargaining chip in negotiations for regime assurance. International economic sanctions and political condemnation are skillfully used as propaganda to strengthen domestic unity, enhance the leader's charisma, and justify a "holy war" against external hostile forces. Conflicts of values in the Western world, discord among allies, and the diversion of international attention to other regional conflicts are seen by North Korea as opportune moments when external pressure relatively weakens. Simultaneously, they are perceived as excellent opportunities to regain international attention through calculated, limited military provocations (missile launches, hints of nuclear tests, etc.) or diplomatic maneuvering, and to extract practical benefits such as food aid and sanctions relief. A somewhat distorted sense of self-efficacy, "the world pays attention to our country, and international affairs move according to our actions," transforms seemingly irrational actions into rational choices within their own logic.

4.3. Strategic Implications of Dispatching Troops to Ukraine: Reaffirmation of the "Blood Alliance," Acquisition of Combat Data, and Expectations of Reciprocity
The fact that North Korea supplied weapons and ammunition to Russia in the Ukraine conflict, or reportedly dispatched mercenaries or laborers, can be analyzed as having extremely calculated, multi-layered strategic implications beyond mere cooperation with a traditional friendly nation. Through this, North Korea, firstly, clearly demonstrates its "blood alliance" relationship with Russia to the international community, especially to hostile Western nations, and appeals to its presence as a member of the authoritarian, anti-U.S. axis opposing Western support for Ukraine. Secondly, it collects valuable combat data on the effectiveness of its domestically produced weapons (artillery shells, rockets, etc.) in a modern battlefield, which can be used for future weapons development, improvement, and arms export strategies to third countries. Thirdly, it expects, in return from Russia, not only urgently needed food and energy assistance but also the provision of militarily critical advanced technologies and know-how, such as ballistic missiles, reconnaissance satellites, and nuclear submarines. Fourthly, it aims to provide combat experience to dispatched soldiers and technicians, albeit limited, to improve the overall readiness and tactical level of its military. It is thought that these strategic benefits were pursued. This "track record" in Ukraine is likely to enhance the prestige of the Kim Jong Un regime domestically and be maximally utilized as domestic propaganda and as material for diplomatic and military intimidation against the international community when raising military tensions on the Korean Peninsula in the future.

4.4. The Spread of "War Without a Story": Consumption of Zelenskyy's Personal Narrative and the Structure of International Compassion Fatigue
President Zelenskyy's skillful information strategy at the outset of the Ukraine conflict and the heroic narrative of resistance, appealing to emotions characteristic of his background as an actor, played an extremely important role in evoking widespread empathy in the international community, especially in Western countries, and in mobilizing unprecedented levels of military, economic, and humanitarian aid. However, as the war dragged on and its horrors became daily news, this narrative as a "personal hero's tale" was gradually consumed, and a phenomenon that could be called "compassion fatigue" began to be noticeably observed in international society. If armed conflict were to erupt in regions of relatively low international concern, such as the Korean Peninsula or, as discussed later, Belarus, there is a high probability that there would be no internationally recognized charismatic leader like President Zelenskyy, nor a universal grand cause (story) that directly resonates with Western values, such as a "fight for freedom and independence." Such a "war without a story," lacking a leader or a grand cause, finds it extremely difficult to effectively attract international attention and empathy. Media coverage tends to be fragmented and superficial. As a result, ordinary citizens outside the conflict parties can only perceive it abstractly and somewhat detachedly, thinking, "Another unfortunate war is happening somewhere in the world, but it's not directly related to our lives," or "War is tragic and I'm against it, but there's nothing specific I can do." Consequently, the momentum for active engagement in conflict resolution or concrete action for humanitarian aid does not build. This demonstrates the harsh reality that in modern society, where information circulates instantly but selectively in vast quantities, an extremely powerful and easy-to-understand "narrative" is indispensable for capturing people's limited attention (attention economy), stirring emotions, and prompting action. And "war without a story" harbors a dangerous modern structure where it can become protracted and bogged down without sufficient international scrutiny or intervention, leading to a more serious and widespread humanitarian crisis.

Chapter 5: The World Enters an "Era of Re-division" – The Pluralization of Values and the Fluidity of Order

5.1. The Twilight of Universal Values and "Civilizational Bloc-ification": The Depths of Multipolarity and New Axes of Confrontation
As symbolized by the series of measures against Harvard University, values such as freedom, democracy, and human rights, once led by Western nations and believed to be universal and absolute, have lost their luster in the 21st century. They are facing fundamental questioning of their universality and application methods from non-Western countries, especially Global South nations with increasing economic and political influence. Sometimes, they face outright rejection and the presentation of counter-values. This does not signify the "end of history" and the final victory of liberal democracy as predicted by Francis Fukuyama after the Cold War. Rather, it suggests that Samuel Huntington's warning at the end of the 20th century about a "clash of civilizations" is becoming a reality in the form of a new "civilizational bloc-ification," based on more fundamental and emotive cultural, religious, and historical identities, different from past ideological confrontations. The world is not in an era of American unipolar dominance, nor a simple bipolar confrontation between the U.S. and China. It is fully entering a truly complex and fluid multipolar era where multiple major civilizational spheres, each with its own values and worldview, interact, sometimes sharply confronting each other over economic and technological hegemony, or seeking new alignments.

5.2. The Rise and Fall of "Narrators" and the "Game of Silence": New Contests of Narrative Power in International Relations
The explosive development of information and communication technologies and the global spread of social media have dramatically increased the importance of "narratives" in international relations—that is, strategic "storytelling" to legitimize a country's actions and claims, and to elicit empathy, support, or fear and caution from other countries. Nations that can effectively construct persuasive "narratives" based on their history, culture, values, and national interests, and disseminate them through diverse media, can exercise soft power, win international public opinion, and expand diplomatic influence. On the other hand, even superpowers like the United States, which once exclusively enjoyed this "power of narration," face the risk of rapidly declining influence if the consistency and credibility of their narratives are shaken domestically or internationally. The United Kingdom, leveraging the advantage of English as an international common language, its historically cultivated diplomatic and information strategy skills, and its global media outreach represented by the BBC, is attempting to establish a new international position as a "narrator" in the post-Brexit era. France continues to appeal to the international community with the universality of European values since the Enlightenment and its unique diplomatic philosophy rooted in Gaullism. In contrast, authoritarian states like China and Russia skillfully avoid direct "narrative" contests on the Western turf of "free speech" and "open debate." Instead, they quietly but steadily achieve their strategic goals and expand their international sphere of influence through the "game of silence"—the exercise of economic influence, sophisticated information manipulation in cyberspace (dissemination of fake news and public opinion誘導), and thorough domestic censorship and unification of historical perception. Furthermore, countries like India are emerging, which, without necessarily eloquently "narrating" themselves, naturally enhance their voice in the international order and attract other nations through their "sheer existence"—their huge population, growing economic power, and unique "strategic autonomy"—which itself becomes a powerful message. International relations have truly entered a new dimension of competition and struggle over this narrative power, invisible yet extremely important.

5.3. Belarus, Taiwan, Kashmir: A Chain of Potential Flashpoints and a Warning of Global Polycrisis
Potential flashpoints where "war without a story" could erupt and become bogged down without sufficient international engagement are not limited to the Korean Peninsula. Belarus, under Russia's strong military and political influence and with its highly opaque domestic situation, is a dangerous entity that could become a new front in the Ukraine conflict or trigger serious regional instability due to an internal power struggle, potentially leading to accidental clashes with NATO. The Taiwan Strait, at the forefront of the U.S.-China hegemonic struggle and a chokepoint in the global semiconductor supply chain, is a constant major concern for the international community due to the possibility of China abandoning "peaceful reunification" and resorting to force. If a military invasion becomes a reality, its economic and geopolitical impact would be global, and the worst-case scenario of a direct U.S.-China military conflict cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, the Kashmir region, where two nuclear-armed states, India and Pakistan, have long disputed territorial claims, constantly harbors the risk that terrorist activities or small-scale military clashes near the border could easily escalate into large-scale armed conflict, fueled by domestic circumstances and rising nationalism in both countries. These regional conflicts may not occur and end in isolation; they could take on the character of proxy wars between major powers or interact and influence each other, triggering a polycrisis—a complex of cross-border crises such as food shortages, energy crises, large-scale refugee and displaced person outflows, and disruptions to global supply chains. This sounds a warning about the potential to fundamentally shake the stability and prosperity of the entire international community.

5.4. Japan's Responsibility at a Historic Turning Point: A Paradigm Shift from a "Passive Peace Nation" to a "Proactive Value-Creating Nation"
At this unprecedented historical turning point, which can be called an "era of re-division," Japan can no longer afford to remain complacent within the traditional paradigm of "passive pacifism" long upheld since the post-war era, or the "pursuit of economic prosperity" with the U.S. alliance as a given premise. It is time for Japan to shift its fundamental national stance (paradigm) from passively observing the structural changes in international society as a distant "fire on the other side of the river" to deeply understanding the dynamics and historical significance of these changes, protecting its own national interests, and proactively and creatively contributing to the stability and prosperity of the entire international community as a "proactive value-creating nation." This means going beyond the conventional security policy framework of merely strengthening defense capabilities and reaffirming alliances. It implies shouldering a larger historical mission: to actively contribute to solving difficult global challenges facing the international community, such as climate change, pandemics, poverty, and human rights violations, based on Japan's unique culture, historical experience, and future-oriented values, and to powerfully present to the international community a new hopeful "narrative" that promotes cooperation and coexistence rather than division and confrontation. Just as Emperor Qin Shi Huang brought the new governing principle of legalism to China, medieval Europe established social order based on the divine right of kings underpinned by Christian theology, and modern civic revolutions spread the universal idea of basic human rights to the world, the contemporary world, amidst confusion and uncertainty, also craves a new "principle of order" and its bearer. Japan has the qualification and historical responsibility to actively, rather than timidly, engage in its formation.

Final Chapter: Japan's Survival Strategy – "Noble Reverence" and the Dissemination of New Values: "Empathic Democracy" and "Crossthink" as Guiding Lights

In this harsh international environment, characterized by a historic "re-division," a Auidity of values, and the potential for "wars without a story" to erupt and spread in various places, it is becoming an increasingly difficult path for Japan to secure a firm position in international society and guarantee its national survival and sustainable prosperity for the future based solely on material national strength indicators such as economic power and technological capability. What Japan should truly aim for is not the conventional hegemonic thinking of intimidation by military force or domination of other countries through economic influence. Instead, it should become an entity that earns true "Noble Reverence" from the international community through its world-renowned unique cultural depth, its sincere and consistent history of aspiring for peace, its profound ability to empathize with the pain and joy of diverse others, and its constructive and attractive vision underpinned by an ethical sense of responsibility towards future generations. This means establishing, both domestically and internationally, a national brand as a country that, without unnecessarily raising its voice, possesses firm ethical and moral authority, and quietly yet resolutely contributes to world harmony, sustainable development, and, above all, the defense of human dignity.

To achieve this lofty yet uniquely Japanese goal, Japan should proactively disseminate the following two new value concepts to the international community and steadily and creatively embody these ideals through domestic institutional reforms and concrete international contribution activities:

1. Building "Empathic Democracy" and Expanding it to International Society:
As detailed in the provided paper "Japan's Governance Structure Reform and the Concept of 'Empathic Democracy': A Proposal for a New Representative System with Dual Voting," many contemporary representative democracies face serious structural challenges such as dysfunction due to institutional fatigue, distortions in representation, and the rise of populism raging domestically and internationally. Japan should conceive of "Empathic Democracy" as a new national design and present it to the international community as a concrete prescription to overcome these universal challenges.

Core Philosophy: "Empathic Democracy" aims to institutionally incorporate into the political system not only representation based on geographical affiliation ("where one lives") but also individuals' internal connections, empathy, and willingness to support ("where one was born, where one wants to support"). This is an attempt to overcome inter-regional conflicts of interest and societal divisions, foster a sense of national solidarity and mutual assistance, and pursue a more mature form of democracy.
Specific Institutional Design (Dual Voting System): As its core institution, a "dual voting system" will be introduced in national politics (particularly by reorganizing the House of Councillors into a regional bloc representation system). Voters will cast a "first vote (regional representative vote)" to elect a representative for their residential bloc, and optionally, a "second vote (empathy support vote)" indicating their desire to "support this specific region" outside their own bloc. Based on the national aggregation of these empathy support votes, a portion of the House of Councillors seats will be additionally allocated to each bloc as "empathy seats." This aims to directly reflect the national will for support towards depopulated areas, disaster-stricken regions, and economically challenged areas in political decision-making.
Linkage with Local Autonomy Reform: This national-level reform will be closely linked with fundamental local structural reforms (abolition of local assembly members' retirement allowances, thorough visualization of assembly costs, residents' choice of assembly systems, and reorganization into a broader regional bloc system centered on "prefectures" with an intermediate centralized model) to enhance its effectiveness and legitimacy.
International Significance: The concept of "Empathic Democracy" is not merely a domestic reform; it has the potential to provide significant intellectual stimulation to the international community as a concrete prescription from Japan for the crisis of democracy faced by countries worldwide. It could serve as an counter-axis to populism and exclusionism, demonstrating a more humane and inclusive political system.
2. Creating Co-creative Knowledge through "Crossthink" and Promoting an International Intellectual Ecosystem:
To solve the myriad problems of a divided and complex modern world, new methods of knowledge creation that transcend existing academic disciplines and frameworks of thought are indispensable. Japan should promote the "Crossthink" thinking theory society concept, as outlined in the "Crossthink Manifesto (Official Draft ver. 1.6)," as a pillar of its international intellectual contribution.

Core Philosophy: Crossthink aims to "respect the freedom of thought and Auidity of discourse" while simultaneously "valuing relationships between people and respect in contemplation," and to "combine the natural genesis of thought with the intersection of experiential values." It is "not something that interjects forced rules or external morals," but rather "values the natural贯通性 (transversal continuity) of emerging values," and particularly "envisions a new cycle of knowledge that unearths and valorizes latent knowledge born from dialogue with AI, connecting it to intellectual networks." As basic value rules, "aggressive thinking and thinking that promotes violence or discrimination are prohibited," and "logical development aimed at harming others is prohibited." However, these are naturally integrated into the system as "common sense" standards, with the ideal being that "order is maintained not by coercion, but naturally through the visualization of high-quality contemplation and mutual respect."
Specific Mechanisms and Processes:
Contemplation Categories and "Star Chart of Thought": While derivatively adopting the Dewey Decimal Classification system from library science as a basis for knowledge classification (General Works, Philosophy, History, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, Engineering/Technology, Industry, Arts/Fine Arts/Music, Language, Literature, etc.), it encourages the natural emergence of new interdisciplinary and cross-boundary areas of contemplation by freely combining these categories (e.g., "Information Intelligence x Philosophy," "Future Design x Language"). These contemplations, by combining basic classifications and dynamic user tagging, aim for an interface where they are interconnected and beautifully visualized as a "Star Chart of Thought," much like stars forming constellations in the night sky.
Two Types of AI and Token Economy: Two types of AI models will be introduced: "AI-A (Contemplation Promotion Type)," which inspires individual contemplation and supports inquiry and deep dives, and "AI-B (Deepening Verification Type)," which comprehensively verifies records of contemplation submitted by users (such as dialogue logs with AI) and evaluates and records their depth, originality, and inspirational power for others. "Thought Tokens (THT)" and "Depth Tokens (DPT)" will be awarded according to respective activities, functioning as incentives that lead to further deepening of intellectual activities, such as access rights to anonymous digests and participation rights in special intellectual events. This token economy, while ensuring transparency and immutability using blockchain technology, aims to honor the visualization of intellectual activity and contributions to the network, quietly supporting value creation through contemplation.
Ethics and Governance: Crossthink will be based on the ethical standards of collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) while respecting the freedom of contemplation to the maximum extent. For published contemplation digests, minimal guidelines prohibiting clear violations such as aggressive thinking, discriminatory expressions, and infringement of others' rights will be established. If violations are recognized, measures such as non-disclosure will be taken, but a minimalist approach will be maintained to avoid excessive management. The publication of contemplation content will be based on explicit user consent, and published digests will undergo thorough anonymization. AI evaluation biases and information reliability will be continuously monitored. Outlines of evaluation criteria and operational policies will always be public, and an open process allowing users to raise objections and express opinions will be established to ensure transparency and democratic operation.
International Significance and Future Prospects: The Crossthink concept is a future-oriented intellectual platform that positions AI not merely as a tool for efficiency, but as a "collaborative partner" that extends human intellect, stimulates creativity, and supports new discoveries and deep insights. While its "technical foundation is within reach, LLM integration, value assessment, and the realization of a sustainable intellectual market require high-level cooperation, ethical vigilance, and careful design" (Feasibility: ★★★☆☆), its "conceptual innovation in valorizing individual thoughts born from AI dialogue, drawing a star chart of connected spirits, and encouraging intellectual prosperity is unparalleled" (Uniqueness: ★★★★★). By deploying this platform internationally and promoting intellectual exchange and co-creation across cultural and linguistic barriers, it is expected to become a catalyst for generating innovative ideas and interdisciplinary joint research aimed at solving global-scale problems. "Protecting its spirit from incentive-driven homogenization or contamination is essential to realizing its potential," and "what opens the future is not mere technology, but an unwavering commitment to the quiet ideals presented here." It represents a new form of original and peaceful intellectual leadership that Japan can contribute to the world, marking "the beginning of a new voyage into knowledge."
While "Empathic Democracy" aims to institutionalize empathy and solidarity at the macro political and social system levels of nations and regional communities, "Crossthink" promotes cross-disciplinary integration and qualitative deepening at the micro level of individual and human-AI, or individual-to-individual, thought, dialogue, and knowledge creation processes. Although these two concepts differ in their scope and approach, they are aligned in their pursuit of the universal values of "empathy" and "creative integration of knowledge," which are critically lacking in contemporary society. They can function as powerful twin pillars of Japan's new value dissemination, mutually reinforcing each other.

To persistently and sincerely disseminate these new Japanese-originated values to the international community, creatively merging them with Japan's traditional culture cultivated since ancient times (such as the "omotenashi" spirit of detailed consideration for others and emphasis on harmony; the history of coexisting with diverse nature and cultivating unique aesthetics and views on life and death from it; and the wisdom of "nemawashi" and "sontaku" in gradually coordinating differing opinions and standpoints to reach consensus) and the global appeal of Japan's contemporary content industry (such as the deep empathy for diverse characters depicted in anime, manga, and games; the construction of complex, multi-layered worldviews; and the exploration of universal themes like friendship and solidarity). And to steadily embody these ideals through concrete domestic institutional reforms and specific international contribution activities in a way that resonates with people around the world. This is the path for Japan to build a unique international status as an "entity that earns Noble Reverence," demonstrate true international leadership, and secure national survival and prosperity in this difficult era dominated by division and uncertainty. This is the grave responsibility our generation owes to future generations. This path is by no means smooth, but it should be the most creative, most peaceful, and most hope-filled contribution to the future that Japan can draw from the depths of its history and culture.

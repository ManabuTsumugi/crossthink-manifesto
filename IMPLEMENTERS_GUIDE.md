**A Mini-Guide for Crossthink Implementers**

---

**【Fundamental Ideas of Crossthink】**

* Creation of an intellectual network that respects freedom of thought and the fluidity of discourse.
* Uncovering, valuing, and sharing the "latent knowledge" born from actual dialogues with AI.
* Establishing a fluid ecosystem of knowledge, untethered by intellectual tensions or deficiencies.

**【Basic Implementation Design】**

1.  **AI-A (Thought Facilitation Model)**
    * An AI dialogue partner that supports individual contemplation, asks questions, and facilitates deeper exploration.
    * Awards Thought Tokens (THT) upon completion of dialogues.

2.  **AI-B (Deepening Evaluation Model)**
    * Reviews submitted thought records and evaluates their depth.
    * Awards Depth Tokens (DPT) upon passing evaluation.
    * Evaluation criteria: "Originality," "Stimulative Power on Others," "Logical Consistency," "Social Contribution."

3.  **Thought Token (THT) / Depth Token (DPT)**
    * Tokens representing the value of intellectual contributions.
    * Used for purposes such as accessing anonymous digests, gaining participation rights for special events, acquiring honorary titles, etc.

4.  **Thought Classification and Visualization**
    * Basic classification derived from the Dewey Decimal Classification.
    * Allows free combination of fields and dynamic tagging.
    * Generates a "Star Map of Thought" for visualization.

5.  **Minimum Countermeasure Rules**
    * Prohibits thoughts promoting violence, discrimination, or malicious harm to others.
    * Publication requires explicit user consent and thorough anonymization.

6.  **Governance Design Policy**
    * Publicly disclose evaluation standards and operational policies (summary level).
    * Permit processes for user objections and governance proposals/discussions.
    * Maintain a principle of minimal interventionist management.

7.  **Blockchain Technology Utilization**
    * For token management and ensuring the immutability of records.

8.  **Risk Monitoring**
    * Monitor for risks such as: Speculation (e.g., polarized betting-like gamification), homogenization/dilution of evaluation standards.
    * Requires careful and deliberate design of evaluation mechanisms to foster deep intellectual discussion, not just superficial metrics.

**【Comments for Implementers】**

* **No need for perfection at once:**
    * Starting with a small prototype (Proof of Concept - PoC) is perfectly fine.
* **Make practical choices for LLM integration:**
    * Consider readily available platforms like OpenAI API, Google Vertex AI, Hugging Face Spaces, and other open platforms.
* **Develop rapidly with a simple backend:**
    * Consider building the initial token system backend on a simpler blockchain or ledger technology for quicker development cycles.
* **Go beyond a "mere crowd":**
    * Let's strive to build a place where people who pursue truly free and deep thought can connect through shared purpose.

Now, let's embark on the journey to build the Star Map of Thought.

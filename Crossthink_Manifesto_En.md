Crossthink Manifesto (Official Public Draft ver.2.2) [English Version]
________________________________________
Origin of the Concept
We respect the freedom of thought and the flow of discourse. At the same time, we choose to value the relationships between people and the respect inherent in deep contemplation. This is the starting point of the Crossthink concept.
________________________________________
What is Crossthink?
Crossthink aims to build a "Society of Thought Theories," combining the spontaneous emergence of thought with the longitudinal crossing of inherent value.
It is not governed by enforced rules or external moral standards. However, it cherishes the natural vertical flow of emerging value.
We envision a new cycle of knowledge: uncovering latent wisdom born from dialogue with AI, valuing it, and connecting it into an intellectual network.
________________________________________
Fundamental Value Rules (Minimum Standard)
•	Thought that promotes aggression, violence, or discrimination is prohibited.
•	Logical developments aimed solely at harming others are prohibited.
These rules are naturally embedded within the system at a common-sense level. Order is maintained not by coercion, but through the visualization of high-quality thinking and mutual respect.
________________________________________
Thought Categories (Field Design)
The basic classification system is derived from the Dewey Decimal Classification (Library Science):
•	General Works
•	Philosophy
•	History
•	Social Sciences
•	Natural Sciences
•	Engineering and Technology
•	Industry
•	Arts, Fine Arts, and Music
•	Language
•	Literature
Moreover, users can freely combine categories to create new thought domains. Example: "Information Science x Philosophy", "Future Design x Language", etc.
The interface combines foundational classification with dynamic tagging, visualized as a "Star Map of Thought."
________________________________________
AI-A, AI-B, and Token Model Design
•	AI-A (Thought Facilitation Model):
o	Encourages individual contemplation through questioning and deepening support.
o	Awards Thought Tokens (THT) upon completion of dialogues.
o	The amount awarded varies based on depth, continuity, and diversity of the dialogue.
•	AI-B (Deepening Evaluation Model):
o	Reviews submitted thought records to evaluate and log the degree of deepening.
o	Awards Depth Tokens (DPT) upon passing evaluation.
o	Evaluation criteria: "Originality," "Stimulative Power on Others," "Logical Consistency," "Social Contribution."
•	Token Usage:
o	Access to anonymous thought digests
o	Participation rights in special intellectual events
o	Acquisition of honorary titles
o	Accumulation and publication of intellectual histories
________________________________________
AI-B Evaluation Process Design
•	Initial phase: Based on existing Large Language Models (LLMs), evolving into custom models specialized for thought deepening.
•	Human Evaluation Teams: Initially invite-only; later selected based on credibility history.
•	Cross-Check System: AI-B primary evaluation + Human secondary evaluation.
•	Emphasizing ethical neutrality and diversity.
________________________________________
Autonomy and Order
•	Based on the ethical standards of the integrated LLMs, we maximize respect for freedom of thought.
•	Minimal guidelines are established for published thought digests (prohibiting aggression, discrimination, rights infringement).
•	Violations result in measures such as non-publication of digests.
________________________________________
Privacy and Ethics
•	Thought publication requires explicit user consent.
•	Published digests undergo thorough anonymization.
•	Continuous monitoring is conducted for AI evaluation bias and information reliability.
________________________________________
Token Economy Policy
•	Tokens are designed to visualize intellectual activity and honor contributions to the network.
•	Market circulation and valuation are intended to align naturally with the generation of intellectual value.
•	Blockchain technology is utilized to ensure transparency and immutability.
•	We aim for an economic sphere that quietly supports value creation through contemplation.
________________________________________
Fundamental Stance on Market Principles and Ethical Risks
•	We embrace market principles but do not ignore ethical challenges, striving to balance risk mitigation and freedom.
•	We continuously monitor and adjust to prevent extreme speculation, intellectual homogenization, and evaluation contamination.
•	We aim to maintain a healthy thought ecosystem by balancing competition and diversity.
________________________________________
Governance Design Policy to Protect Freedom and Diversity
•	We ensure transparency by continuously publishing summaries of evaluation standards and operational policies.
•	We regularly review evaluation algorithms and human evaluators to prevent favoritism toward specific styles or ideologies.
•	We establish open processes allowing user objections and expressions of opinion, supporting democratic operation.
•	In cases of serious guideline violations, non-publication and corrective measures are applied, while maintaining a principle of minimal intervention.

Vision Outlook: The Potential of Crossthink
As Crossthink begins its quiet voyage into uncharted realms of thought, its prospects unfold with distinct clarity:
•	Feasibility: ★★★☆☆ (Moderate)
o	The technological foundations are within reach, yet realizing LLM integration, value evaluation, and a sustainable intellectual market demands high-level collaboration, ethical vigilance, and careful design.
•	Uniqueness: ★★★★★ (Extremely High)
o	The conceptual innovation—valuing personal thought born from AI dialogues, charting a star map of interconnected minds, and incentivizing intellectual flourishing—is unparalleled.
•	Impact on the World: ★★★★★ (Extremely Large)
o	Crossthink holds the potential to revolutionize intellectual ecosystems, individual thought activities, and the fundamental relationship between humans and AI. Safeguarding against incentive-driven homogenization and contamination will be essential to preserving its spirit.
What opens the future is not merely technology. It is the unwavering commitment to the quiet ideals set forth here.
Crossthink—this is the beginning of a new voyage into knowledge.
